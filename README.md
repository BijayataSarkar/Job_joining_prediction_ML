# Job_joining_prediction_ML
This project predicts whether a candidate will join a company or not after receiving a job offer. The goal is to use multiple machine learning models (SVM, Random forest classifier, K-Neighbors Classification, Naive Bayes Classifier) and compare their accuracy.

# Models Implemented

- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
- **Random Forest Classifier,**
- **K-Neighbors Classification**
- **Naive Bayes Classifier**

Each model is written in its own Jupyter notebook and can be run independently.

## üìÅ Notebooks

- `SVM_model.ipynb`
- `Random_forest_classifier_model.ipynb`
- `K_neighbors_classification_model.ipynb`
- `Naive_bayes_classifier_model.ipynb`

You can open them in Google Colab for easy execution.

# Goal

Compare multiple ML models and find the one that best predicts job joining likelihood.
